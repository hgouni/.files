* ctrl + l will cause readline to redraw the current line; can be used to make
  sure we're in a good editing state

* the section 'SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS' in `man bash` has docs for bash's
  (extended) builtins like `read`

* null termination flags (find -print0, grep --null, xargs --null, readlink
  --zero, ...) can be used to process filenames containing newlines or spaces
  safely
  
* To kill defunct processes: `ps -ef | grep defunct`, note the PPID, and run
  `kill <PPID>`
